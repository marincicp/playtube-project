# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is a video and music streaming application built with React. Users are able to search for and play videos and listen to songs using the YouTube API. The application is composed of three main components: a search form, a list of videos, and a component to play videos. The search form allows users to input keywords and retrieve a list of relevant videos. The list of videos component displays the search results and allows users to select a video to play.

This is one of my first projects in React, first i used class-based components, leter i recreate into function component and state management is handled with the useState and useRef hooks.

This project was a great opportunity for me to dive into the world of React. I am excited to continue learning and utilizing this powerful framework to discover its full potential and to create complex applications.
